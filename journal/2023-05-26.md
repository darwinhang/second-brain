continued my #leetcode and `System Design Interview` streak. I actually do feel like I'm becoming a better programmer as I'm at least getting some solution in a reasonable time. The book helps to expose me to concepts I otherwise wouldn't have to consider and I'll probably create an evergreen note just for that.

## some interesting concepts from the book
### trie
I keep forgetting this is pronounced `try` and not `trieeeeee`. It looks like the last time I did the LC problem it was in Kotlin and on December 25th, 2020. Isn't that Christmas?!?!
