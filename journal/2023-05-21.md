did a couple #leetcode problems

went through a couple chapters of the `System Design Interview` vol 1 book.

## some interesting concepts from the book
### Consistent hashing
#### resources

#### useful for
distributed systems.
so that if number of partitions changes, hash keys don't need to be regenerated for all keys.
keeping partitions balanced, e.g. partition 1 doesn't have all of the data

### Bloom Filters
#### resources

[bloom filter in Cassandra](https://cassandra.apache.org/doc/4.0/cassandra/operating/bloom_filters.html)

#### useful for
finding hashed information quickly.
sstable lookup (Cassandra/Scylla), [link to sstable description](https://www.scylladb.com/glossary/sstable/)

### merkle tree
#### resources
[merkle tree in riak](https://docs.riak.com/riak/kv/latest/learn/concepts/active-anti-entropy/index.html)
hash tree, where checking parents allow to identity contents of child. I think this is a core datastructure for blockchain too.
#### useful for 
conflict resolution. if comparing two nodes after one has gone online, can see where/when the conflicts are and being restoration.
