did some #leetcode problems after running some errands, but have been focusing on frontend type questions since I paid for a subscription and I want to be more well-rounded.

going through some of the `System Design Interview` vol 1 book.

## some interesting concepts from the book
### block servers
moving the file encryption, chunking, compression steps from client responsibilty to server.
this allows the file contents to be stored in cloud storage in smaller blocks, which allows potentially faster retrieval, but also updates as only modified blocks need to be updated and downloaded. 

#### useful for
managing large file uploads

#### open questions
what if a large portion of the file changes, do all the block_ids downstream of the changes need to be incremented?
