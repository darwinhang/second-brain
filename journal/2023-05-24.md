did a couple #leetcode problems in the morning. simple bit counting and then an array subsequence problem

went through a couple chapters of the `System Design Interview` vol 1 book.

## some interesting concepts from the book
### fanout
I'm familiar with this term from some of the Kotlin coroutines (and I think goroutines) patterns for concurrency. Also the name is descriptive.

`hotkey` problem. Consistent hashing can be used to mitigate, basically spread hotkeys around so they don't end up on the same small set of servers. There can still be a problem if one key is extremely hot (see etsy)[https://www.etsy.com/codeascraft/how-etsy-caches]

### local IDs
Ids are local within a group, e.g. 1-1, group messaging

#### useful for
chat applications, where it might be too complex to generate global IDs
