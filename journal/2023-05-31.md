woke up and did a couple #leetcode problems, including one that I got in an interview before, but couldn't answer during that time. Unfortunately, I had to look at a hint for the two pointer solutions. Also went back to the spell potions and was actually able to complete it this time in under 20 minutes or so, most of that was debugging my binary search implementation. It is funny that I wasn't able to get a working solution before even though I had a similar approach.

went through some of the `System Design Interview` vol 1 book.
