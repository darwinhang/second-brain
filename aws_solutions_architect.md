# aws_solutions_architect

To work at smaller firms, and also if I ever want to build on AWS myself, I should learn more about the AWS ecosystem. One of the ways to increase exposure is to pass one of the solutions architect exams.

I think the side benefit is that I'll get more exposure to cloud networking, which is something I've never spent that much time learning about.

It does seem like it is basically forcing myself to read the docs.
